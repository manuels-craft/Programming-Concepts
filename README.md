# Programming Articles

A collection of articles where I explain programming concepts in a clear and practical way, using real-world examples and insights from personal experience, books, and code reviews.  
This repository is where I draft and organize my posts before publishing them on platforms like LinkedIn, or Medium.  
While many articles will focus on JavaScript, I may also cover other programming languages and broader software development concepts.
