Use this checklist to **measure your growth based on tangible progress**, so you have evidence of your skills before seeking feedback from others.

## 1. Can You Debug a Problem You Can Reproduce?
If you can replicate a bug and fix it in a structured way, you're mastering one of the most important developer skills.

**Example:**  
Your login form breaks after signup. A solid approach:
1. Reproduce the issue (create a new user, try logging in).  
2. Check console errors or backend logs.  
3. Inspect API responses and examine failure points.  
4. Fix the bug and verify the fix.

**Why it matters:**  
Recruiters look for people who can solve real problems independently. Clear commit messages and notes in your README about challenges solved are great proof.

## 2. Have You Built One Project That Looks Like a Senior Developer Made It?
Rather than multiple simple apps, build **a single polished full‑stack application** that demonstrates real-world competence.

**Project example:**  
A web app with:
- Authentication (sign up, login, password reset)  
- Database (e.g. users, projects, tasks)  
- API integration (REST or GraphQL)  
- Clean folder structure (clear separation of concerns)  
- Deployed online with live demo or screenshots

**Recruiters notice:**  
Readable code, thoughtful structure, documentation, and real features like auth, API, and deployment.

## 3. Have You Read at Least 3 Quality Programming Books?
Books help you adopt professional thinking patterns and improve code quality.

**Recommended reads:**  
- *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin – readable, maintainable practices  
- *Designing Data‑Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann – system architecture insights  
- *You Don’t Know JS* (series) by Kyle Simpson – deep JavaScript knowledge

**Why this matters:**  
Reading authors who think deeply helps you reason about trade-offs and articulate decisions—skills that stand out in interviews.

---

## 4. Have You Explored a Real‑World Codebase?
Study an open-source project to understand real‑world architecture and conventions.

**Example:**  
Fork or browse a project like **Next.js** or another library you use. Examine:
- Folder structure and organization  
- Naming conventions for components and files  
- How tests, error handling, and configuration are managed

**Why this matters:**  
It shows you understand community‑accepted patterns and can adapt faster in team environments.

## Choose Jobs That Help You Grow
When job hunting, do not aim to meet 100 percent of requirements. Instead:

- Meet the core requirements  
- Identify at least three skills listed in the job description that you're still learning

---

### Pro Tip: Learn Before the Interview
If a required technology is new to you:

- Spend a few hours on a crash course or tutorial
- Learn the basic commands or features (for example, Docker’s `build` and `run`)
- Understand the problem the technology solves

You can honestly say in interviews:  
“I’ve started learning X and understand how it fits into a project—I’m confident I’ll pick it up fast.”

**Why this matters:**  
It shows initiative, honest self-awareness, and the drive to learn.

## Final Takeaway
If you can confidently check most of these boxes, you’re more capable than you think. If not, now you know exactly where to focus. Use this checklist to guide your learning and career growth objectively.
